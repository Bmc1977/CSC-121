Look how simple this class is! All that work we did earlier paid off. All we do is open each file, scale it, and save it back. The ZipProcessor class takes care of the zipping and unzipping without any extra work on our part. This seems to be a huge win.

Creating reusable code isn't easy. It generally requires more than one use case to make it clear what parts are generic and what parts are specific. Because we need concrete examples, it pays to avoid over-engineering to strive for imagined reuse. This is Python and things can be very flexible. Rewrite as needed to cover the cases as they arrive on the scene.
